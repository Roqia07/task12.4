# PID Control Class for Arduino

## Project Description

This repository contains an arduino code that generates a generic pid class to adjust the speed of a DC motor based on the feedback from a sensor.
## Features

- PID controller class with adjustable Kp,Ki ,Kd
- use a exp smoothing filter in the pid class
- control the motor speed based on sensor feedback
- Output limited for PWM control
